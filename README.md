# Schrödinger cats growing up to 60 qubits and dancing in a cat scar enforced discrete time crystal

Here we provide the digital simulation codes for our work [Schrödinger cats growing up to 60 qubits and dancing in a cat scar enforced discrete time crystal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08284). Numerical simulation of quantum circuits was performed using [MindSpore Quantum](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindquantum) framework.
